# GFM

------

## Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

## Syntax highlighting

Code blocks can be taken a step further by adding syntax highlighting. In your fenced block, add an optional language identifier and we'll run it through syntax highlighting. For example, to syntax highlight Ruby code:

~~~ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
~~~

~~~python
import re

text = "ElasticMining"
pattern = re.compile(ru"\w+")
pattern.match(text)
~~~



## Fenced code blocks

Standard Markdown converts text with four spaces at the beginning of each line into a code block; GFM also supports fenced blocks. Just wrap your code in ``` (as shown below) and you won't need to indent it by four spaces. Note that although fenced code blocks don't have to be preceded by a blank line—unlike indented code blocks—we recommend placing a blank line before them to make the raw Markdown easier to read.

Here's an example:

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

## Strikethrough

GFM adds syntax to create strikethrough text, which is missing from standard Markdown.

~~Mistaken text.~~

## URL autolinking

GFM will autolink standard URLs, so if you want to link to a URL (instead of setting link text), you can simply enter the URL and it will be turned into a link to that URL.
